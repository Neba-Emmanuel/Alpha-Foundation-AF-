<p> This foundation is the brain-child of the Mr ITOE HENRY ITOE. Its inception can be dated as far back as 2007, when he was still a student in the University of Yaounde I. Here he was the student president of the OROKO student, resident in Yaounde. Disagreements,tribalism and other forms of malice amn the Oroko students particularly and elites generally, prompted Mr ITOE to work for the community. He decided to bring together all the Oroko sudents despite their ethnicity, counsel many on the ills about tribalism and preached hardwork to them. When calm returned the endeavor never died down. He then diverted to Humaniterian work to the less privileged, orphans, gender based violence(GBV) and entrepreneurship for aspiring youths. He single handedly sponsored this endeavor that gave him a tick from all as sundry. Henry, based his program on the word of God with inspiration from Matt. 25:35-36.
							   â€˜I was hungry and you fed me, thirsty and you gave me a drink. I was a stranger and you received me in your home, naked and you clothed me. I was sick and you took care of me, in prison and you visited me. [GNB].
